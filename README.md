# PZero-test Llyn-Padarn

This is a test dataset to be used with the PZero 3D geomodelling application.

The dataset is inspired, with simplifications, from the British Geological Survey [Llyn Padarn (S&D) 1:25 000 Classical Areas Map](https://shop.bgs.ac.uk/Shop/Product/BSP_CA38C), published in 1988. This dataset has been used by Andrea Bistacchi for years for teaching and testing since it includes complex, but still cylindrical, cuspate-lobate folds (with strong layer thickness variation) crosscut by normal faults of different length and slip (some faults have their tip-lines within the modelling domain: a problem for some modelling algorithms). The original dataset has been modified to enhance its teaching and testing content, and should be by no means taken as representative of the real geology of the Llyn Padarn area.
